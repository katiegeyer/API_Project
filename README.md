<!-- How to connect user information (name) to group pages
(organizerId, organized by '') -->

**Type in create group form is throwing validation error only for In Person

**Will not re-direct me to group page after updating group IS UPDATING THOUGH

Allowing for Organizer privileges/non-member view on group detail page

My default 500 DNE page is a groups detail page?  When I go to a route that doesn't exist (i.e. groupId)

When no events, No Upcoming Events

Connect validation errors on create group page



Need to:
Update,
Get all User Groups (organizer view vs. non-member)
