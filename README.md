create event isn't dispatching

Is it possible to include an minimized 'event' on groups page or do i need to manually stick it in there

Allowing for Organizer privileges/non-member view on group detail page

My default 500 DNE page is a groups detail page?  When I go to a route that doesn't exist (i.e. groupId)

When no events, No Upcoming Events.  Counting past events, counting future events

Connect validation errors on create group/create event page



Need to:
Update,
Get all User Groups (organizer view vs. non-member)
